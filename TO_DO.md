(by the sliders in try it yourself) getting rid of the white box and maybe adding in a bold? might be too much in bold?


maybe a white box around the whole try it yourself section

interactive indicator inside the text
     toggle?
    or reset and action button
     remember that the button or sentence whatever it is need to be obvious and connect to the action

reset button on the hill at the base of the try it yourself

style the project credits

john is concerned about 
the warning sign being too much

*Later today John will send me additional design feedback
