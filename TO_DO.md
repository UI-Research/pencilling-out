-reset button on the hill at the base of the try it yourself

-style the project credits

-Replace the National Housing Conference logo with type-only credit: “In Partnership with the National Housing Conference”
-mobile, hide header

- Optional – Could we explore adding “haze” at the horizon? Some element that overlaps the text that goes from opaque blue near the hill to transparent a little higher so the words appear to fade out as they go behind the hill?

- Seems weird that the first thing here is the “default modeled values” alert. Can we move this, or maybe just have this note right under the title in regular body font?
-Alerts: I’d consider changing the sign shape from a diamond to a square or rounded box, just to conserve space. I’m worried the alert text will awkwardly wrap inside the diamond.

-Move the gray “apartments / AMI renters” figures under the Gap numbers (instead of above)
-Where the roof meets the house, can we replace this gap with a subtle shadow? This has bugged me since day one and I can’t seem to let it go. (Thinking something like this )
-I suggest we remove the hanging part of the crane. To me it creates just a little too much visual complexity in the area we want them to be focused on the houses. I also think it still looks cool without it. 
-The ribbon of road on the green hill is distracting. Looks like a hose (or a mistake)
-The developer dude having pink lips is still kinda weird for me. Can his mouth just be black?
