			<h1>Title of Project</h1>
			<p>
				There is not enough affordable housing in the United States.
			</p>
			<p>
				For every 100 extremely low income households, there are only 29 available affordable rental units. That means that more than 8 million families considered extremely low-income are living in substandard conditions or scrimping on necessities like food or childcare to pay for housing.  (use numbers from published report) These are families who are working, but whose hourly wage jobs often don't pay enough to cover basic needs. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The solution may seem simple: why not build more affordable housing?
			</p>
			<p>
				It turns out, however, the will to build is not enough. For developers to build, they must have the promise they will eventually earn a profit, however small. But affordable housing developments cannot offer that promise: without government subsidies, there is a huge gap between what these buildings cost to construct and maintain and the money they bring in. And until that gap is closed, developers can't build affordable homes. 
			</p>
		</section>
		<section class="step">
			<h1>Why is there a gap?</h1>
			<p>
				Development costs a lot of money, and developers only have access to a finite amount of funding.
			</p>
			<p>
				With luxury housing, this isn’t a problem, because developers can raise rents and bring in plenty of money. Luxury and market-rate buildings are also eligible for grants and small loans. But affordable buildings must rely on bank loans and tax credits—and neither of those will supply enough money to cover costs. Even if a developer uses the most inexpensive materials to build on the most inexpensive land, if the building is truly affordable to families earning minimum wage, the funding available will never equal the cost to build and the gap will remain.
			</p>
			<p>
				The problem with the gap, too, is that as long as it exists, developers can’t receive financing. A gap means no building, and no building means no options for the millions of low-income families looking for safe, affordable homes. 			
			</p>
			<p>
				To illustrate this problem, we examined data from the Denver metro area, which is experiencing a growth in rental housing demand but is not a traditionally high cost city. The rental housing conditions in Denver are largely representative of other U.S. cities. 
			</p>
		</section>
		<section class="step" id="scroll-build">
			<h1>Building the gap: Uses</h1>
			<p>
				Buildings cost money to build and run: to developers, those costs are called uses. The first major cost is the cost of the land you plan to build on, called the acquisition cost. In Denver, acquisition costs ranged from [$] to [ $]. In some cases, developers are able to use public land to develop affordable housing, but when that option is not available, there is little a developer can do to bring the cost of land down. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Once you have the land, the next major cost is the cost of construction, which includes the cost of labor. Our research showed that construction costs varied much more across cities than it did across projects, meaning that construction costs are largely a product of market forces, rather than a developer's decisions. Construction costs in Denver ranged from [$] to [$].
			</p>
			<p>
				Another important use to consider is the developer fee, or the profit the developer earns. This profit is built into the calculation of the gap, since a developer can't build if he's not going to earn any money from the project. Affordable housing developers can choose to defer a portion of the fee, leaving more money to cover construction costs. The developer then recoups the deferred portion of the fee from the money the project brings in. This assumes, of course, that the gap is closed and the project is bringing in money--and for many affordable housing developments, that's not the case.
			</p>
			<p>
				While these are the major uses a developer must account for, other costs include: design fees, interim costs, permanent financing fees, operating and debt service reserves, and project management fees.			
			</p>
		</section>
		<section class="step">
			<h1>Building the Gap: Sources</h1>
			<p>
				To cover the costs of building and operating a housing development, developers rely on a number of different sources of money. The primary source is a debt. Developers take loans from the bank based on the amount they will be able to pay off over time. [Insert some details here about Denver, typical mortgage sizes, etc.?] 
			</p>
			<p>
				Beyond the primary bank loan, developers might also pay for their uses through tax credits or grants subsidies. All of these sources, however, are very limited. The amount of money available through tax credits and grants is not enough to build the amount of affordable housing cities need. [Again, are there numbers from Denver we can use?]
			</p>
			<p>
				Once the building is built, rental income becomes a source developers can draw on to pay off their uses. This assumes, however, that the building is built--and many can't ever get enough in loans, grants, and tax credits to close the gap and begin building. 
			</p>
		</section>
		<section class="step" id="scroll-close">
			<h1>Can we close the gap...with bigger loans?</h1>
			<p>
				If you manipulate sources enough, you'll notice that you can close the gap by taking out a very large loan. So, why don't developers do this?
			</p>
			<p>
				In short, the banks won't let them. This is because the size of the loan a bank will grant you depends on your project's net operating income (NOI). Net operating income is calculated by multiplying rent by the number of apartments, accounting for some vacancies, and subtracting operating costs from that amount. Banks use NOI to calculate how much debt a project can support, assuming the developer still needs to have some cash flow to cover unexpected expenses and accounting for the interest that debt will accrue. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But if the rent is set at rates considered affordable, that NOI is not going to be very high, which means the size of the loan is not going to be very large. Low rental income, then, contributes doubly to the gap. 
			</p>
		</section>
		<section class="step">
			<h1>Can we close the gap with...more apartments?</h1>
			<p>
				As a creative developer, you might consider adding more apartments to your building to increase the NOI. Though this will increase construction costs, other costs, like the acquisition cost and developer's fee, will remain the same, helping to close the gap. There are, however, some caveats.
			</p>
			<p>
				Consider, first, that adding more apartments is only useful if you can fill them. In rural areas, you might not have enough residents to fill a 100-apartment building. In urban areas this is more feasible, because you can have a low footprint in a highrise and you will have an easier time filling the apartments. Still, there are social and economic downsides to creating large communities of affordable housing. While building a 100-apartment building is okay, building a 500-apartment building might serve to segregate low-income families from the rest of a city--and it might mean you're breaking zoning laws, too.  
			</p>
		</section>
		<section class="step">
			<h1>Can we close the gap...with higher rent?</h1>
			<p>
				Charging more in rent might seem like an obvious solution, since it means both higher income and a larger loan. But when does affordable housing stop being affordable?
			</p>
			<p>
				In defining affordable housing, we consider the Area Median Income (AMI). Housing must be affordable to families earning less than 60 percent of AMI in order for a developer to receive low-income tax credits, though some affordable housing is targeted toward people who earn less than 30 percent of AMI.
			</p>
			<p>
				In Denver, AMI for a family of three was $72,100, so earning 60 percent of AMI meant a family took home $43,260 and earning 30 percent of AMI meant a family had $21,630. As man working as a telemarketer and supporting his wife would earn $36,544 in Denver--slightly less than 60 percent AMI for a family of two. 			
			</p>
			<p>
				What can these families afford? The industry standard--and general rule of thumb--is that you shouldn't spend more than 30 percent of your income on rent. So, to make a unit affordable to an extremely low-income family, you could charge no more than $540 per month. You could charge up to $1081 and still call it affordable housing, but now you risk shutting out extremely low-income residents, like the single mom with two children working as a retail cashier and earning $21,125. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Either way, you'll notice as you toggle through the options that there's no way to raise rent enough to close the gap. You can make it smaller, but the only way to close it is to raise rents so high they're no longer affordable. 
			</p>
		</section>
		<section class="step">
			<h1>So...how can we close the gap?</h1>
			<p>
				<strong>The only way to close the gap is with subsidies.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Subsidies come in different forms. There are those given to renters, allowing them to pay more rent than they can technically afford, and there are those given to developers to help defray building or operating costs. The nuances of the subsidies are less important than the fact that they are necessary to building affordable housing. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>You can try it for yourselves.</strong> You're the developer now, with full control over your costs and your rent pricing. See if you can manipulate the sources and uses to close the gap, bearing in mind everything we've learned about affordable rent, loan sizing, building sizes, and fixed costs.
